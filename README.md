# Basic 5e 2025 Layout for Obsidian Fantasy Statblocks

This custom layout brings the aesthetic of the **2025 Monster Manual** to your Obsidian vault. It is designed to match the new official styling as closely as possible, featuring dynamic headers, refined typography, and print-quality spacing.

## ✨ Features

### **2025 Official Styling**  
Meticulously tweaked borders, fonts, and spacing to match the latest 5e design language.

### **Smart Dynamic Header**
- **No Image:** The monster name and type span the full width.  
- **Image Present:** The text automatically wraps to the left while the image pins to the top-right corner.

### **Advanced Data Parsing**  
Built-in handling for newer 5e.tools data formats ensures smooth rendering of complex properties while maintaining full compatibility with standard CLI tool data.

### **Clean List Formatting**  
Messy text blocks (like multi-attack descriptions or spell lists) are automatically re-styled into readable, bolded lists.

### **Print-Ready**  
“Aggressive” CSS fixes remove unnecessary padding for crisp, compact statblocks.

## 🧰 Usage

To use this style, specify the layout name in your statblock code block:

```statblock
layout: Basic 5e 2025
name: Beholder
image: [[MyBeholderImage.png]]
stats:
```

## ⚠️ Compatibility & Limitations
### ITS Theme

This layout does not currently support specific ITS Theme styling features. It is fully functional and usable in its current state, but it may not inherit ITS-specific aesthetic overrides or custom theme hooks.

### Image Aspect Ratio

For the best results, ensure your monster images are cropped square or close to square. While the layout will handle most aspect ratios gracefully, square or near-square images produce the most consistent visual results.

## 🐞 Known Issues

- **Legendary Actions description loads slightly late.**  
  This is mostly a non-issue but worth noting: the description text for Legendary Actions appears moments after the rest of the block because there is no clean injection point *after* the trait header in the layout.

- **Delayed loading when “Parse Frontmatter” is enabled.**  
  This is also a non-issue but I wanted to note. Statblocks will not render immediately while the plugin is still parsing frontmatter.  
  Once the plugin finishes, simply click the file again to render as expected. This is not a layout issue. The more frontmatter monsters in your vault the longer this can take.
